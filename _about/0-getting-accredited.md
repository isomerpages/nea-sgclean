# About SG Clean

Launched on 16 Feb 2020, the SG Clean movement calls on all Singaporeans to adopt good personal and environmental hygiene habits. It galvanises collective action, from individuals to businesses and community to work together to raise our cleanliness standards.


NEA, together with Enterprise Singapore (ESG), the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), the Ministry of Education (MOE), the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), will rally various sectors to commit to upholding good sanitation and hygiene practices, though the “SG Clean” campaign.


Under the campaign, the “SG Clean” quality mark will be progressively rolled out to various sectors, covering premises with high human traffic. The “SG Clean” quality mark will first be rolled out to hawker centres, and subsequently to public transport nodes such as train stations and bus interchanges. The plan is to also cover preschools, schools, government buildings, hotels, conference venues, tourist attractions, cruise and ferry terminals, airport terminals, the integrated resorts, shopping malls and F&B outlets. Each Government agency will champion the adoption of the “SG Clean” quality mark amongst the stakeholders within their sectors.


Stakeholders will have to commit and adhere to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists, covering areas such as management oversight, cleaning methodology, toilet cleanliness, and general public hygiene. These checklists will be tailored to the requirements and operations of the various businesses. Premises with the “SG Clean” quality mark will have their premises audited by agencies or appointed third-party assessors, so as to ensure that they maintain a high level of cleanliness and public hygiene (see Annex B for “SG Clean” campaign visual). Members of the public can also contact NEA at the 24-hour hotline at 1800-2255 632, to provide feedback on the hygiene conditions of these premises.
