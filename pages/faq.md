**I had earlier been assessed prior to the start of circuit breaker measures. When will I know the results of the assessment, and get the collaterals for display?**

**What is the SG Clean campaign about?**


The SG Clean campaign was launched on 16 February 2020 as a proactive response to minimise the spread of COVID-19 and to make cleanliness a way of life in Singapore. SG Clean campaign aims to raise the hygiene standards and transform cleanliness level of public spaces and rally premises operators to take ownership by adopting the SG Clean Quality Mark. Under the campaign, the SG Clean quality mark will be progressively rolled out to various sectors, covering premises with high human traffic including hotels, tourist attractions, shopping malls and F&B outlets.


To further expand and sustain the SG Clean campaign beyond COVID-19, the SG Clean Taskforce was formed on 6 March 2020 to drive and galvanise collective action through:


- Adopting good personal habits
- Adjustment to social norms
- Ensuring cleanliness of public spaces

**How do I get certified?**


Premises operators will have to commit and adhere to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists and advisories, covering areas such as management oversight, cleaning methodology, toilet cleanliness, and general public hygiene. These checklists and advisories are tailored to the requirements and operations of the various businesses. 


Premises operators will have their premises audited by agencies or appointed third-party assessors to ensure that they maintain a high level of cleanliness and public hygiene. Interested premises operators can contact the respective industry sector leads or appointed assessor to arrange for an audit through the SG Clean website. More information can be found at the SG Clean website (sgclean.gov.sg).
