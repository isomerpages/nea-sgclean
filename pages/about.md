### About SG Clean

*Concerted action needed from everyone to elevate cleanliness and public hygiene standards and make them the new norms.*
  
Launched on 16 February 2020 by the National Environment Agency (NEA), the SG Clean campaign seeks to rally stakeholders and members of the public to do their part, by adopting good personal habits and social responsibility, to raise standards of cleanliness and public hygiene in Singapore and safeguard public health.

It is envisioned that the SG Clean campaign will instil a national “keep clean culture”, where keeping Singapore clean is an integral part of our lives.

#### For individuals

**Adjusting social norms, adopting good personal habits**

To help prevent community spread of COVID-19, it has been necessary to make adjustments to social norms in Singapore.

While the SG Clean campaign will help to reduce public health risks from the current COVID-19 situation, the longer-term objective is to instil greater awareness of good hygiene and cleaning practices, and to ensure that these are sustained at high levels beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak.

Everyone can play a part in keeping themselves and others around them safe, by adopting good personal habits.

#### For Owners of Premises

**Ensuring cleanliness of public spaces**

An important component of the SG Clean campaign is the SG Clean quality mark, a premises-based sanitation and hygiene indicator. The SG Clean quality mark requires organisations to commit to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists, to safeguard public health in Singapore.

To raise hygiene standards and transform the cleanliness levels of public spaces, the SG Clean campaign has involved owners of premises adopting the SG Clean quality mark, to reflect their commitment and ownership of maintaining high standards of environmental public hygiene at their premises.

Through collective action by all stakeholders, we can contribute towards safeguarding public health and making Singapore a cleaner, more liveable and pleasant environment for all.
