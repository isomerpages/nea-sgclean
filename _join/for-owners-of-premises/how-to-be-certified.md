You may obtain the relevant checklist(s) for your premise(s) according to sectors **[here](../assessments)**.


**2. Contact relevant agency/appointed assessor to arrange assessment when ready**


The respective agencies and/or their appointed assessors will be able to arrange and provide details for the assessment.
