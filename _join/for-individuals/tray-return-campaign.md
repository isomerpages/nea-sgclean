It’s now more important than ever to practice good personal and public hygiene habits so remember to:
1. Wash or sanitise your hands before and after eating
2. Avoid sharing utensils. Use serving spoons and don’t double dip
3. Don’t spit out food on tables and trays. Use tissues.
4. Return trays to designated tray return points and keep tables clean for the next user
5. Throw used tissue and wet wipes in trash bins
 
Let’s make our eating places clean, safe and pleasant for all!
