As individuals, we can contribute to safeguarding our environment, by taking necessary precautions, to reduce the spread of diseases such as COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) and dengue.

**Bin litter responsibly**

At public areas, remember to bin your litter properly, to curb the transmission of diseases, and to prevent litter from becoming unintentional breeding habitats for dengue-transmitting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
 
Over the past three years, [more than 3,000 mosquito breeding habitats](https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/nea-brings-forward-national-dengue-prevention-campaign-and-rolls-out-additional-new-tools-to-combat-dengue-with-increasing-evidence-of-a-sustained-switch-in-dengue-virus-serotype) were linked to containers and receptacles found at public areas. More than half of these receptacles, such as plastic containers and empty drink cans, had been discarded as litter by people.

**Keep homes pest-free**

It is equally important that we stay vigilant at home. We can do our part by removing stagnant water from potential mosquito breeding habitats and regularly practising the [Mozzie Wipeout](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/prevent-aedes-mosquito-breeding), to reduce the mosquito population.

**Did You Know?**
 
NEA has a map showing areas with higher adult Aedes aegypti mosquito population, and thus higher risk of dengue transmission, as detected by NEAâ€™s Gravitrap Surveillance System.
 
[View the map](https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/Aedes) on the NEA website, and get notified on areas with higher Aedes aegypti mosquito population through [myENV](https://www.nea.gov.sg/myenv).
