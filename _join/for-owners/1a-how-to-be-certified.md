> ### Premises are awarded with the SG Clean quality mark after an official assessment

**The assessment is based on a checklist of requirements for sanitation and hygiene standards.** <br>

> ### What do I need to do?

**1. Obtain checklist and ensure requirements are met**<br>


You may obtain the relevant checklist(s) for your premise(s) according to sectors **[here](../assessments)**.


**2. Contact relevant agency/appointed assessor to arrange assessment when ready**


The respective agencies and/or their appointed assessors will be able to arrange and provide details for the assessment.


**3. Get assessed and put up the SG Clean quality mark if requirements are met**


If all the requirements in the checklist are met, the SG CLEAN quality mark and checklist will be awarded to you for display at a prominent location within your premises.


*What if I did not meet all the requirements?*


If lapses are detected at your premises, the appointed assessors will make known the lapses and will advise you to carry out the necessary rectification work. Once the rectification work has been carried out, contact the respective agencies and/or appointed assessor for a re-assessment.
