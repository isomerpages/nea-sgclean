notification: <a> Thank you for
  your support for the SG Clean Quality Mark. 
  With the continued transition towards COVID-19 endemicity, the SG Clean Quality Mark will be discontinued upon its expiry on 30 Jun 2023.
  The PHC will introduce a checklist to guide premises operators to continue the practice of good hygiene routine.
  The checklist will be available on the PHC website (www.publichygienecouncil.sg) from 17 Jul 2023 onwards.
  We look forward to your continued support as we make Singapore truly clean.
